# ft_printf
School C project - ft_printf works just like printf, with full conversions and options

For this project, we had to code a printf-like function from scratch.
Allowed functions were : <b>write, malloc, free, exit and the 3 stdargs</b>.

ft_printf works just like regular printf, you can use it with <b>flags, 
precision, lenght modifiers and conversion specifiers</b> listed in the man.
